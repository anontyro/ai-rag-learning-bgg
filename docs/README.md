# Learning Plan (RAG)

This repository contains a step-by-step learning path to build an AI agent backed by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), starting with ChromaDB and TypeScript.

- Start here: [Part 1 — ChromaDB + TypeScript](./part1-chromadb-typescript.md)
- Next (preview only in this part): Part 2 — Bridging Retrieval to Local Models with Ollama

Use the modules, hands-on exercises, and checkpoints to progress from fundamentals to a working local retrieval API.
